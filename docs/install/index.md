## Install Plone

First, choose a Plone user interface, or frontend.
You can read {doc}`/conceptual-guides/choose-user-interface` to help inform your choice between Volto and Classic UI.

If you choose Classic UI, then you can read {doc}`/conceptual-guides/compare-buildout-pip` to help inform your choice between Buildout and pip for an installation method.

Then choose one of the following installation methods.
If you are following a [Plone training](https://training.plone.org/), it should specify which option to choose.

{doc}`create-project-cookieplone`
:   This is the recommended way to install Plone for a new project with the Volto frontend.

{doc}`/admin-guide/install-buildout`
:   This is one way to install Plone with the Classic UI frontend.
    Using Buildout will be the most familiar way for admins who have experience with Plone 3, 4, or 5.

{doc}`/admin-guide/install-pip`
:   This is one way to install Plone with the Classic UI frontend.
    It provides a basic installation without many additional tools to help with development.

{doc}`create-project`
:   Installing Plone 6.0 with `cookiecutter-plone-starter` was the recommended way to install for a new project with the Volto frontend, but it is now deprecated in Plone 6.1.

{doc}`Install Plone as a contributor </contributing/index>`
:   This option is for developers who want to contribute to Plone and its packages.
